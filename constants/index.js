    description: 'The core component of the introductory Computer Science classes at Duke are weekly coding exercises hosted on the website that makes it barely bearable to complete them. I took on a challenge to redesign it without making the quality-of-life changes and aesthetics my main focus. Instead, my goal was to articulate a clear intention for every new feature, backing it up by scientific learning theories, and then identify ways to test whether the change actually makes a difference in the learning experiences of novice programmers.',

Taking this matter into my own hands, I have fully restructure their UI, retelling the story of their menu in a new light. Every item now has an appealing visual representation instead of the plain text description, while the website itself is filled with animations, making the customer experience intuitive, interactive, and playful.',

    description: 'For my project at the Cooper Hewitt Museum, I tackled the challenge of making the museum more engaging for children. I developed an activity booklet that encourages creativity and exploration, allowing kids to interact with art through drawing, coloring, and imaginative play. The booklet also provides parents with simple prompts to help engage their children in the experience. The goal was to create a fun, inspiring journey through the exhibitions that fosters a positive association with museums.',

    description: "I noticed that while popular New York City attractions like Times Square draw large crowds, neighborhoods like Yorkville remain largely unexplored by tourists. This results in overcrowded tourist spots and missed opportunities to showcase the city's diverse areas. To address this, I developed a case study for the augmented reality (AR) tour guide app that offers an interactive, budget-friendly alternative to traditional tours. The app allows local residents to share stories, historical facts, and hidden gems about their neighborhoods through location-based content, which users can access by pointing their phones at buildings or landmarks. For my prototype, I focused on the intersection of E 93rd Street & Lexington Avenue in Yorkville, identifying key locations like local businesses, street art, and historical spots that could be enhanced with AR markers. I incorporated features such as 3D messages from business owners and overlays of historical imagery, creating an engaging and community-driven experience that connects tourists with the authentic, everyday life of the neighborhood.",

    description: '"Introduction to Visual Studies” is the class most Duke students take either to figure out if art is something they want to pursue in college or to get an easy graduation credit for this area of knowledge. Instead, they are presented with a textbook where walls of text overpower the expected focus on visual studies. With the goal of engaging students whose primary career interests are not related to arts or whose knowledge in the field is minimal, I conceptualized the project around the overarching theme of experiencing art rather than memorizing theoretical information about it. This project transforms the textbook into an art gallery where the students are transported by means of AR. The users are able to see the artworks on the walls of their own rooms, listen to an audio guide, follow along with the text, and take both written as well as voice notes.',
