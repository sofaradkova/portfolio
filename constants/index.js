    description: 'The core component of the introductory Computer Science classes at Duke are weekly coding exercises hosted on the website that makes it barely bearable to complete them. I took on a challenge to redesign it without making the quality-of-life changes and aesthetics my main focus. Instead, my goal was to articulate a clear intention for every new feature, backing it up by scientific learning theories, and then identify ways to test whether the change actually makes a difference in the learning experiences of novice programmers.',

    description: '"Introduction to Visual Studies” is the class most Duke students take either to figure out if art is something they want to pursue in college or to get an easy graduation credit for this area of knowledge. Instead, they are presented with a textbook where walls of text overpower the expected focus on visual studies. With the goal of engaging students whose primary career interests are not related to arts or whose knowledge in the field is minimal, I conceptualized the project around the overarching theme of experiencing art rather than memorizing theoretical information about it. This project transforms the textbook into an art gallery where the students are transported by means of AR. The users are able to see the artworks on the walls of their own rooms, listen to an audio guide, follow along with the text, and take both written as well as voice notes.',

Every item now has an appealing visual representation instead of the plain text description, while the website itself is filled with animations, making the customer experience intuitive, interactive, and playful.',

So many people see technology as the enemy of authentic connection but we believe in creating digital worlds that enrich our experiences as human beings in the physical world, that draw us to explore, that encourage us to meet others. I think the future of tech is in creating digital immersive experiences that redefine how we perceive human bonds and communities. To bring this vision to life, I am working on the front-end features for our player communication and experimentation platform.',
